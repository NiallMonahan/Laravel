Week 1: Setup and Foundation
In the first week I agreed on my topic and ERD with the Ann choosing an Event Management system as the focus i installed a new Laravel project and set up Laravel Breeze for authentication, ensuring users could register and log in after connecting the project to a my database through the .env file, i created the Event model, migration, controller, and seeder using the php artisan make:model Event -mcrs command I then added seed data to populate the database, and implemented the “View All Events” feature to display all events stored in the database.

Week 2: Read & Component Design
During the second week i added the reading functions for events i added the index() and show() methods in the EventController to retrieve and display event data from the database i also created a navigation link to the “View All Events”. i designed an EventCard component using Tailwind and displayed the events. I then built the show.blade.php view and the EventDetails component to display individual event details.

Week 3: Create & Store
In the third week i added the option to allow users to add new events i began by adding a “Create New Event” route and navigation button enabling users to access the event creation form, i then built a reusable EventForm component that could be used for both creating and editing the events. In the EventController i added create() and store() methods to display the form validater user input and handle image uploads before saving the data to the database. I created an AlertSuccess component that displays confirmation messages after successful actions finally i tested the create functionality to ensure all inputs and file uploads worked correctly.

Week 4: Edit, Update and Finalization
In the final week i focused on completing the update and delete functionality to finalize the CRUD workflow i implemented the edit() and update() methods in the EventController reusing the EventForm component to allow users to edit existing event data. I added a Cancel button for better user UX. I also added a Delete button completing the full CRUD cycle, and verified that all operations worked smoothly. Finally i improved the overall styling ensured consistent responsiveness.
